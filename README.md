# Grid_Lemon
HTML CSS JavaScript

## Completed
- 100 cells
- right click pick a color

## Problems
- Grid on margin: auto; becomes center positioned but not fill the whole screen.
- Provided is full width, then the cells become more than the required 100
- Increasing the cell size to fill the space works but then the mousedown events and position changes state.
- Time was also against me.

## Conclusion
- Left half screen even though CSS width is 100% !important.

## Learning Phase
- Very challenging assignment whereby a lot of attempts and readring were made.
- Internet resources are helpful when having a skill to find solutions.

## Attempts
- This fills the screen and it works but colorpicker was the issue:
